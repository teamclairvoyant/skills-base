<h1 align="center">Welcome to skills-base ðŸ‘‹</h1>

### Description.
1) The objective behind this application is to maintain the skillsets and proficiency level of 
all CV employees at a centralized location. CRUD operations along with reports will help management 
and People Success Team to understand employeesâ€™ competency levels and to guide them for the next 
levels (also to utilize them over projects)
2) A skills matrix is a framework used to map employees' skills and their levels. It's a grid that 
  contains information about available skill and their evaluation. It is used to manage, plan, and 
  monitor existing and desired skills for a role, team, department, project, or an entire company.

- ## Description.
1) The objective behind this application is to maintain the skillsets and proficiency level of 
all CV employees at a centralized location. CRUD operations along with reports will help management 
and People Success Team to understand employees’ competency levels and to guide them for the next 
levels (also to utilize them over projects)
2) A skills matrix is a framework used to map employees' skills and their levels. It's a grid that 
  contains information about available skill and their evaluation. It is used to manage, plan, and 
  monitor existing and desired skills for a role, team, department, project, or an entire company.
